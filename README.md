# Plant-Disease-Detection
This project aims to identify plant leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It preprocesses plant images, trains a deep learning model for classification, and provides accurate predictions of plant health. The goal is to assist farmers and researchers in early disease detection to improve crop yield and reduce losses.
